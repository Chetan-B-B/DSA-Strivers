// Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

// The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

// Example 1:

// Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
// Output: [0 0 1 1 2]

//  ? Idea: We will have 3 pointers, low, mid and high. 0 to low will have 0's, low to mid 1 and high to arr.length -1 will have 2's. but mid to high have unsorted array  and next is  sorting
